    <p>Hi, my name is Sebastian. I am 21 years old. I am studying Engineering, majoring in Software. I am in my fifth year.

### Motivations
I chose *IoT Product Development* as I already had some familiarity in working with IoTs through a subject earlier on in my course. I figured that because of this familiarity, I would be able to have fun applying my learnings creatively, rather than struggling with just learning to bring something to the bare minimum. The technology itself was of interest to me, as I have been exploring realtime communications technology in software for a while out of my own volition, and as a potential space for my capstone project later in 2019.

### Objectives
I would like to deepen my understanding of IoT product design, not just conceptually, but technically and practically. I believe that by understanding the architecture and design of IoT solutions. I want to have enough of an understanding to confidently propose IoTs in a solution to clients in the future, should the need arise.

## Learning Contract
### Learning Goals
I want to learn how to make my own IoT device and solutions.

### Group Strategy
I will work with my peers.

### Resources & Strategies
I would like to read more about it. WIP

### What is to be Assessed
My deliverables for this studio are:
1. Design and develop a solution using IoT technology
2. Get a server in the cloud running to conntect IoT devices
3. Program a microcontroller to the device I am making so that it can connect with the cloud
4. Create a small-scale prototype of the solution
